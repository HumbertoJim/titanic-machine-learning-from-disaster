# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This Machine Learning project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic shipwreck using advanced Data Analysis techniques and predictive modeling. The project team explored different Machine Learning algorithms, including logistic regression, multi-layer perceptrons, random forest, and support vector machines, to determine which provides the best accuracy in predicting survival.

## Team Organization
The project was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, divided into different areas of Data Science. The Data Analysis phase involved exploring and cleaning the Titanic dataset to identify relevant features and significant patterns. Data Engineering was responsible for preparing the data for modeling, while the Data Science team implemented and evaluated the Machine Learning models.

## Results
Through a combination of data preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning, the team successfully developed accurate predictive models that can successfully predict Titanic passenger survival. The final model achieved an accuracy of 0.79425.
